This folder contains:
1. The Software.ino code. This file is the brains of the detector. You can upload it to the detector yourself, if you like, by installing the Arduino IDE, and then TeensyDuino. The code is well annotated, and if you don't plan on adding any extra features, all that you might want to touch is the first couple lines.


2. The pitches.h file is simple the definition of various notes. That's right, you can have your detector play music.
